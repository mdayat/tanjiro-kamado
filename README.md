A very simple website built using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` to fulfill [Dicoding Submission](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/123) with the following criteria:
1. Use semantic HTML tags, and
2. Arrange the layout using "flexbox".

The theme of this app is [Tanjiro Kamado](https://kimetsu-no-yaiba.fandom.com/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado) which is one of my favourite anime characters. This app will show you the techniques that Tanjiro possessed from two of his breathing styles: [Water Breathing](https://kimetsu-no-yaiba.fandom.com/wiki/Water_Breathing), and [Sun Breathing](https://kimetsu-no-yaiba.fandom.com/wiki/Hinokami_Kagura).
